/**
 * THE REFUSAL HANDLING IS WHAT THESE ASSERT, because the refusal handling is what the two controls
 * this hook replaces got differently.
 *
 * Both of them ask a server to do something to a running sweep, both answer a refusal with 200 and
 * a body, and both are one wrong branch away from telling a reader that the thing they asked for
 * happened when it did not. That is not a cosmetic failure: a reader who believes a bump was
 * requeued stops watching it, and a reader who believes a bump was set aside stops wondering why a
 * lane is not moving.
